            I am a proud Oregon native who has lived in Portland for the last nine years, having moved to the city to attend college at <em>Lewis &amp; Clark</em>. Upon graduation I worked a couple years in retail before landing a temporary role at <em>Nike</em> working in HR. I eventually realized I had a stronger passion for product and consumers, and had the desire to work in a department allowing me explore this intersection. After some hard work and a number of interviews, I eventually found myself in product merchandising. Fast forward a couple of years and I yet again found myself yearning to do something more creative day-to-day and looking to learn a technical skill. It was at this point that I found <em>Epicodus</em> and began the next chapter in my life.
